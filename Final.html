<h3>
	Don't cry, snowman, not in front of me.<br>
	Who'll catch your tears if you can't catch me,
	<div class="col"><p>Darling</p></div>
	If you can't catch me, 
	<div class="col"><p>Darling</p></div>
	Don't cry, snowman, don't leave me this way<br>
	A puddle of water can't hold me close,
	<div class="col"><p>Baby</p></div>
	Can't hold me close, 
	<div class="col"><p>Baby</p></div>
	I want you to know that I'm never leaving<br>
	'Cause I'm Mrs. Snow, 'til death we'll be freezing
	Yeah, you are my home, my home for all seasons
	<div class="col"><p>So come on, let's go</p></div>
	Let's go below zero and hide from the sun<br>
	I love you forever where we'll have some fun
	Yes, let's hit the North Pole and live happily
	Please don't cry no tears now, it's Christmas, 
	<div class="col"><p>Baby</p></div>
	My snowman and me...<br>
	My snowman and me...
	<div class="col"><p>yahh...</p></div>
